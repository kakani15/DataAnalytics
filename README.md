# Car Detection using Python & Haar cascade

## Methods:
The methodology involves a multi-step process, including the curation of a diverse dataset, image
preprocessing techniques, training the Haar Cascade classifier, and integrating real-time car detection
with video streaming using OpenCV. The dataset encompasses various scenarios, featuring different
lighting conditions and occlusions, to ensure the robustness of the trained model. Image preprocessing
involves resizing, color space conversion, Gaussian blur, dilation, and morphological closing to enhance
the quality of input data. The Haar Cascade classifier is trained on the processed dataset, and the
project's architecture is designed to handle real-time video streaming for dynamic car detection.
## Dataset Overview:
The dataset employed in this project plays a pivotal role in training and validating the Haar Cascade
classifier for car detection. It comprises a diverse collection of images featuring various vehicles, with an
emphasis on different lighting conditions, perspectives, and scenarios. Each image in the dataset is
meticulously annotated to indicate car regions, providing ground truth labels for effective classifier
training. The diversity within the dataset ensures the model's robustness, enabling it to generalize well
to novel environments and effectively handle the challenges posed by occlusions and changing lighting
conditions. This carefully curated dataset forms the foundation for the project's success, facilitating the
creation of a Haar Cascade classifier that is not only accurate but also adaptable to real-world conditions.
## Dataset Preparation:
The dataset preparation involves annotating images to identify car regions, providing ground truth labels
for training the Haar Cascade classifier. The dataset's diversity is crucial for the robustness of the trained
model, allowing it to handle real-world scenarios effectively.
